#' @title Equilibrium SOC
#'
#' @description To calculate the change in SOC for year t (deltaSOCt), we need the combination of PDSOCt and DDSOCt, but also the maximum rate of microbial respiration for year t (MRESPt). A key input to MRESPt is WETDAYS, which is calculated as part of this function. Equilibrium SOC can be calculated by solving for deltaSOC = 0, which then avoids the need for SOC measurement.
#' @param PDSOCt Output of calc_PDSOCt()
#' @param DDSOCt Output of calc_DDSOCt()
#' @param SAND Sand % in top 30 cm soil
#' @param RAIN MAP for year t (mm/year)
#' @param Gdays Total number of days in the growing season. Default = 153 (October to March-ish).
#' @param lowSOC Default = FALSE. Different regression equation for respiration rate is applied for low and high SOC to avoid a negative respiration rate (which isn't physically possible). Threshold for what qualifies as "low SOC" is 4,600 gC/m^2 (i.e. 46 t/ha). Low SOC regression equation is applicable for higher SOC, but just with slightly lower R-squared.
#' @param orig Default = FALSE. Use the original DMRESP equations from Ritchie 2020 or the updated ones from Ruan deWet

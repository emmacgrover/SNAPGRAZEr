\title{Loss of biomass during the off season}
\usage{
calc_Lo(Cg, Gdays = 153, d_off)
}
\arguments{
\item{Cg}{Daily consumption rate (g/animal/day). This is the average rate during the growing season - for the dormant season, the equations assume half this consumption rate.}

\item{Gdays}{Total number of days in the growing season. Default = 153 (October to March-ish).}

\item{d}{Stocking density (head/ha)}
}
